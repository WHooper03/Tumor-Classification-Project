# Tumor-Classification-Project
Using machine learning to create an image classifier CNN that sorts through MRI brain scans and identifies tumors. This is a basic beginner project, it lacks some of the proper steps of a production machine learning model (training/test sets, saving model state, and overfitting testing). Overall, it accomplishes the purpose of sorting through the images and classifying them mostly correctly (~96% accuracy). There are a couple of things that I'd like to tweak and intend to implement:
1. Checking if the model works with other MRI brain scans
2. Seeing if the architecture can be improved on
3. Adapted to categorize the *type* of tumor as well
